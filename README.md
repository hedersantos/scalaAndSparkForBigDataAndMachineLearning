## Scala Programming: Level One

### Values and Variables  

`val` immutable, used to declare Constants.  

`var` mutable, used to declare Variables.  

### Strings and Basic Regex  

Scala performs string interpolation when you prepend `s` o `f` to a string.  

### Tuples

Scala tuples are 1-based (their index positions start at 1).  

Use `._` notation to access elements within a Tuple: `tuple_obj._2` accesses  
the second element from a Tuple named "tuple_obj".  

## Lists  

Lists are zero-based! Their index positions start at zero...  

## Arrays  

## Sets  

Scala Sets contains unique elements and may be both mutable or immutable. Sets  
are unordered.   

## Maps  

In Scala, a Map is a collection o Key/Value pairs (just like a Python Dictionary).
